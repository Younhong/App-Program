        <h1>The Rainbow - The God's Promise</h1>
        <p><b>Genesis 9:12-16</b><br><br>
            And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, 
            a covenant for all generations to come: 
            I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 
            Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 
            I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. 
            Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. 
            Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant 
            between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."

        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
            This courses was designed for students who want to learn the basic
            programming skills to make web pages. In the course, HTML 
            (Hyptertext Markup Language) and Javascript will be used as main
            programming languages for web page production. The students will also
            learn about how to stylize their web pages using CSS 
            (Cascading Style Sheets). The lecture will be given to deal with basic 
            concepts together with corresponding programming practices during the
            class. It is expected that throughout the course the students will
            understand how web pages work internally and cultivate abilites to
            computationally think of making web pages.

		<h1>Titus 1:12-14</h1>
		Even one of their prophets has said, 
		<q>Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.</q>
		This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, 
		so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths
		or to the commands of those who reject the truth.
